# FLEP-seq Preprocessing Pipeline

FLEP-seq (full-length elongating and polyadenylated RNA sequencing) allows calculation of the kinetics of cotranscriptional splicing and detects polyadenylated transcripts with unspliced introns retained at specific positions posttranscriptionally.

This pipeline includes basecalling and preprocessing of the FLEP-seq data. 

For the downstream analysis, please refer to `FLEP-seq Downstream Pipeline`

## Inputs

| File format | Information contained in file | File description |

## Notes

`*.read.info.txt` 中的`mRNA`为这条reads有最大overlap的基因，没有考虑链特异性，仅供参考
