## Snakemake Pipelines

The pipelines are designed to create scalable, consistent, and reproducible data. Pipelines are based on [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow management system. 

Please refer to the [`snakemake_pipelines`](./snakemake_pipelines/) folder.

The tutorials for "single-cell tool kits" are available in the [`sctk-tutorials`](https://github.com/WeipengMO/sctk-tutorials) repository.
